## Technical Questions

### 1. Architecture & Design
Q: Why did you choose Python for the firewall implementation?
A: Python was chosen for several reasons:
- Rich networking libraries (scapy, iptables)
- Easy integration with system tools
- Rapid development and prototyping
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support

Q: How does your firewall handle high traffic loads?
A: The firewall implements several optimizations:
- Efficient packet filtering using iptables
- Connection tracking with optimized state tables
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Resource usage monitoring and limits
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed rules

### 2. Security Features
Q: How does your IDS/IPS system detect attacks?
A: The system uses multiple detection methods:
- Signature-based detection for known attacks
- Anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
- Rate-based detection for DoS attacks
- State tracking for suspicious connections
- Real-time packet inspection

Q: What makes your firewall different from existing solutions?
A: Key differentiators include:
- Combined firewall and IDS/IPS in one solution
- User-friendly CLI and GUI interfaces
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive logging system
- Easy configuration and management

### 3. Performance & Scalability
Q: What are the performance limitations of your firewall?
A: The firewall is designed with the following limits:
