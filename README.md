## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Linux operating system
- iptables
- tcpdump
- Required Python packages

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BaselFirewall.git
   cd BaselFirewall
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 setup.py install
   ```

4. Start the firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start the firewall
sudo python3 main.py

# Enable IDS/IPS
sudo python3 -c "from firewall.ids_ips import enable_ids_ips; enable_ids_ips()"

# Check status
sudo systemctl status baselfirewall.service

# View logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/baselfirewall/firewall.log
```

### Configuration

The firewall is configured using JSON files in the `config` directory. See [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration/options_guide.md) for details.

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "firewall": {
        "enabled": true,
        "default_policy": "DROP",
        "interfaces": ["eth0"]
    }
}
```
